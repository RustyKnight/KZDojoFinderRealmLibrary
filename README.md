#KZDojoFinderRealmLibraryThis is a Realm database based implementation of the [ZKDojoFinderLibrary](https://github.com/RustyKnight/KZDojoFinderLibrary)

The intention at the moment is to provide a static database of values for prototyping and demonstration purposes, with future impementations using `Realm` as a local cache and allowing the actual results to be loaded from some other remote service
